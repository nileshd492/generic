Here are **three strong and clear risks** you can include in your DR runbook:

## Risks

1. **DNS Replication Delay or Failure:**
   Potential delays or failures in BlueCat DNS replication might result in extended downtime or inconsistent DNS resolution, impacting recovery time objectives.

2. **Replication Lag in GitHub Instances:**
   Excessive replication lag between the primary GitHub instance (**us-east-2a**) and replica instances could result in data loss or inconsistencies upon failover, negatively impacting data integrity.

3. **Network Connectivity Issues:**
   Network disruptions or latency between AWS environments (**us-east-2**) and On-Premises infrastructure may cause delays or failures during failover execution, hindering the recovery process.
