## GitHub Multi-Region Replication Overview

In an ideal operational scenario, GitHub Enterprise is primarily hosted on an EC2 instance located in **AWS us-east-2a**. All other GitHub instances, including those deployed in **us-east-2b**, **us-west-2**, and the **On-Premises environment**, are configured as GitHub replicas using GitHub Enterprise's built-in replication utilities.

This replication utility ensures that all GitHub replicas continuously receive data updates from the primary instance (**us-east-2a**), maintaining data consistency and integrity across all locations. In the event of a disaster or outage scenario, this replication strategy facilitates rapid failover with minimal data loss, ensuring seamless continuity of GitHub Enterprise operations across regions.
