Here‚Äôs a crisp draft you can add as a section to your DR success write-up:

## ‚è±Ô∏è Duration of Activity

The overall **failover activity took approximately 15‚Äì20 minutes** for the replica in **us-west-2** to be promoted and start serving traffic.

* During this window, GitHub services were unavailable for logins.
* After promotion completed, services stabilized automatically and users were able to authenticate (with a short AD login delay that resolved on its own).

The **failback to us-east-2** was completed smoothly and within expected timelines, with no additional downtime observed after DNS switch-back.

üëâ Do you want me to also create a **timeline view (step-by-step with timestamps)** so management sees exactly when failover, DNS update, login availability, and failback occurred?
