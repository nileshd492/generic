Thanks for the clarification. Here's the revised version to make it broader and more robust:

---

### ðŸ”¹ **Assumptions** (updated point)

4. **Daily Backup Availability:**
   A successful daily backup of GitHub Enterprise is taken using the **On-Premises GitHub instance** and stored on **NFS storage**. This backup process is automated via a **Jenkins job scheduled to run nightly**, ensuring a reliable recovery option is available in case of any failure that prevents standard operations or replication-based recovery.

---

### ðŸ”» **Risks** (updated point)

4. **Backup Failure or Data Corruption:**
   If the automated GitHub backup job fails, or if the backup stored on NFS is corrupted, incomplete, or inaccessible, recovery during a disaster event may not be possibleâ€”especially in scenarios where replication is also unavailable or ineffective. This could lead to extended downtime or permanent data loss.
