Proposal: Enable `--active` flag on GHES replica nodes for smoother DR failover

Hi Team,

Currently, our West and On-prem GitHub Enterprise Server replicas are configured without the `--active` flag, meaning they serve only as standby nodes. In the event of a DR switchover, we need to run `ghe-repl-promote`, which results in a visible outage before the replica starts handling requests.

I recommend enabling these replicas with the **`ghe-repl-node --active` flag**. With active replicas:

* **User traffic is already served locally** in West and On-prem regions, reducing latency and improving user experience during normal operations.
* During a **planned or unplanned failover**, the replica will continue serving requests without a full outage.
* Developers may **not be able to push new code during the transition window**, but read operations (clones, pulls, browsing, PR activity) remain available.
* We still retain full replication from East (primary), ensuring DR readiness.

This change increases overall availability and provides a smoother DR switchover experience for users, minimizing disruption.

Let me know if we should schedule a test cycle to validate this configuration.
