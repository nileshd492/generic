## About DNS Failover

To ensure rapid and reliable recovery during disaster scenarios, DNS failover automation is implemented through **UC4 jobs**. These UC4 jobs handle DNS record updates for the GitHub Enterprise platform across AWS (**us-east-2, us-west-2**) and On-Premises environments.

The UC4 jobs cover the following three DNS failover scenarios:

1. **Availability Zone Failover (Within Region: us-east-2)**
2. **Region Failover (From us-east-2 to us-west-2)**
3. **Cloud Failover (AWS to On-Premises)**

Each scenario triggers an automated DNS flip, updating the DNS (`github.com`) to point to the appropriate, pre-defined target hostname to ensure minimal disruption and downtime.

The Networking team manages and executes these UC4 jobs upon disaster declaration to quickly restore GitHub Enterprise services.
