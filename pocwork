## DNS Replication in BlueCat

DNS changes executed via UC4 jobs are first applied to the **primary node** within the BlueCat DNS infrastructure. Once updated, the primary node automatically replicates these changes to all other BlueCat nodes within a fraction of a second. This rapid synchronization ensures consistent DNS resolution across all locations, facilitating immediate and seamless failover during disaster recovery events.
