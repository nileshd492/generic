Here are **three strong and clear assumptions** you can include in your DR runbook:

## Assumptions

1. **DNS Availability:**
   BlueCat DNS infrastructure remains operational and accessible during disaster scenarios, ensuring DNS updates via UC4 jobs propagate rapidly across all DNS nodes.

2. **Replication Health:**
   GitHub replication between primary (**us-east-2a**) and replica instances (in AWS and On-Premises) is consistently active and healthy, maintaining minimal data replication lag to facilitate quick recovery.

3. **Network Connectivity:**
   Stable and reliable network connectivity exists between AWS regions (**us-east-2**) and the On-Premises environment, ensuring immediate and seamless traffic rerouting upon executing failover procedures.
