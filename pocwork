Here’s a **professional “Next Action Items” section** you can add to your DR success story write-up. I’ve written it in a structured way so you can directly plug it into your report:

---

## 📌 Next Action Items

While the GitHub Enterprise DR test was successfully executed, the following **action items** have been identified to streamline and automate future DR events:

1. **Harness Integration**

   * Configure all GitHub failover and failback scripts in **Harness**.
   * Ensure jobs are parameterized and reusable for future DR drills.

2. **Automation via UC4**

   * Work with the **UC4 team** to create UC4 jobs that will invoke the Harness pipelines.
   * Validate end-to-end automation flow (UC4 ➜ Harness ➜ GitHub failover/failback).

3. **Job Creation & Configuration**

   * Create all required **Harness jobs** for both failover and failback scenarios.
   * Map dependencies, validations, and rollback steps within Harness.

4. **Team Coordination**

   * Establish coordination between **Cloud/Infra team, Harness team, and UC4 team** to align automation strategy and timelines.
   * Define ownership and RACI (Responsible, Accountable, Consulted, Informed) for each step.

👉 Would you like me to also add a **proposed timeline (e.g., 2 weeks for Harness setup, 1 week for UC4 integration, 1 week for dry-run)** so management sees a clear execution plan alongside the action items?
