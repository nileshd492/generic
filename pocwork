Here’s a polished **success-story style write-up** you can share with management. It frames the exercise as a well-executed DR test with clear outcomes, a minor observation, and overall success:

# ✅ Disaster Recovery (DR) Test Report – GitHub Enterprise

**Date of Test:** 🔸(add date here)
**Scope:** GitHub Enterprise Disaster Recovery failover from **us-east-2** (primary) to **us-west-2** (DR site), including DNS switch and AD integration validation.

---

## 🎯 Objective

To validate the **disaster recovery readiness** of GitHub Enterprise by:

* Promoting the replica in **us-west-2** to primary.
* Switching DNS resolution from **us-east-2 → us-west-2**.
* Verifying GitHub availability and AD-integrated authentication.
* Executing a clean **failback** to the primary site in **us-east-2** after the test.

---

## 🛠️ Activities Performed

1. **Replica Promotion:**

   * The GitHub replica in **us-west-2** was successfully promoted to primary.
   * No issues observed during the promotion process.

2. **DNS Switch:**

   * Networking team seamlessly updated DNS from **us-east-2 → us-west-2**.
   * Name resolution changes propagated successfully.

3. **Authentication Validation (AD Integration):**

   * Initial login attempts failed immediately after failover.
   * GitHub authentication (integrated with **hadas.com Active Directory**) became operational within **10–15 minutes**, without manual intervention.
   * Likely related to AD sync/propagation delay, but did not require corrective action.

4. **Failback to us-east-2:**

   * After successful DR validation, failback was initiated.
   * Replica in **us-east-2** was promoted back to primary.
   * DNS was switched back without issues.
   * Post-failback validation confirmed **full functionality**.

---

## 📌 Observations

* **Minor delay in AD logins** post-failover (\~10–15 minutes) that resolved automatically.
* All other services, user access, and integrations functioned as expected.

---

## 🚀 Outcome

* **DR test completed successfully.**
* Demonstrated that GitHub Enterprise can be reliably failed over between regions with minimal disruption.
* DNS updates and replica promotions executed smoothly.
* Authentication integrated with **hadas.com AD** recovered automatically, confirming resiliency.

---

## 🏆 Conclusion

This exercise proved that the **GitHub Enterprise DR plan is effective and operationally ready**. The system was able to fail over and fail back between AWS regions with no major issues. The only noted observation was a **brief AD login delay** post-failover, which self-resolved.

Overall, this was a **successful DR test** and provides confidence in our ability to recover GitHub services during a regional outage scenario.
