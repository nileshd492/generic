Proposal to Enable Active Mode for Replica Nodes on GitHub Enterprise Server

Hi Team,

I'd like to propose an update to our GitHub Enterprise Server configuration across the three regions: East (primary), West, and On-prem.

Currently, our West and On-prem appliances serve as replicas. To improve availability and user experience, I recommend that we enable the **active mode** for these replica nodes using the `ghe-repl-node --active` flag.

**Benefits of enabling `--active`:**
- **Local user requests:** West and On-prem nodes will serve user traffic directly, reducing latency for those regions.
- **Higher availability:** These nodes will continue to function if the primary region (East) experiences downtime.
- **Performance improvement:** Load is distributed, enhancing the overall efficiency of our infrastructure.

Let me know your thoughts on this change, or if you have any concerns before we move forward.
