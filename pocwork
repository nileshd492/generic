Got it 👍 — here’s a **professional, management-ready draft** of your Jenkins DR test report. I’ve structured it similar to the GitHub write-up, but it highlights the **challenges, learnings, and next action items** so management sees both transparency and readiness.

# 🚧 Jenkins Disaster Recovery (DR) Test Report

**Date of Test:** 🔸(add date here)
**Scope:** Jenkins Disaster Recovery failover from **us-east-2** (primary) to **us-west-2** (DR site), covering **1 Operations Center (OC) and 6 controllers**, DNS switch, service validation, and failback.

---

## 🎯 Objective

To validate the **disaster recovery readiness** of Jenkins Enterprise by:

* Shutting down services in **us-east-2** (primary region).
* Starting Jenkins services in **us-west-2** (DR region).
* Ensuring OC and controller availability.
* Executing DNS switch between regions.
* Validating stability and documenting observations.

---

## 🛠️ Activities Performed

1. **Shutdown in us-east-2**

   * Logged in to **1 OC + 6 controllers** in us-east-2.
   * Stopped **nginx** (`systemctl stop nginx`) and removed docker containers (`docker rm`).
   * Confirmed all Jenkins services fully stopped.
   * Networking team switched DNS from us-east-2 → us-west-2 (successful).

2. **Bring-up in us-west-2**

   * Started services on **1 OC + 6 controllers**.
   * Observed that **nginx was already running** on all servers, but docker containers needed to be started.
   * Attempted to use `./start.sh` script — encountered issues due to **hardcoded server references (us-east-2)**.
   * Corrected the script; containers came up, but **OC UI reported license expired**.

3. **License Issue Resolution**

   * Root cause: `jenkins_home` was not fully in sync.
   * Action: Copied `jenkins_home` directory from us-east-2 OC → us-west-2 OC.
   * Result: License issue resolved.

4. **Controller Issues**

   * Docker containers and nginx services were up on controllers, but controllers still showed **down**.
   * Jenkins Support engaged; provided troubleshooting doc ([link](https://test.com)).
   * Applied fix → **2 controllers came up successfully**.
   * Remaining **4 controllers deferred** to next testing iteration due to change window constraints.

5. **Failback to us-east-2**

   * Stopped services in us-west-2, restarted Jenkins services in us-east-2.
   * Networking team switched DNS back to us-east-2 successfully.
   * Post-failback validation confirmed services stable.

---

## ⏱️ Duration & Performance Observations

* **OC startup:** \~1–2 minutes.
* **Controller startup:** \~2–3 minutes for services; \~30 minutes reported for controllers to be fully operational.
* **Replica promotion (overall failover activity):** \~15–20 minutes to get OC functional.

---

## 📌 Key Observations

* `./start.sh` scripts contained **hardcoded server names (us-east-2)** — caused initial failures.
* **License expired issue** resolved only after copying full `jenkins_home`.
* **Controller startup delays**: some controllers took significantly longer (\~30 minutes) to fully initialize.
* DNS switching by networking team worked **smoothly in both directions**.

---

## 🚀 Outcome

* DR activity **not fully smooth**, but provided **valuable learnings** for future readiness.
* OC successfully promoted and 2 controllers brought online in DR region.
* Remaining controllers will be validated in the **next DR iteration**.
* Rollback to us-east-2 was clean and successful.

---

## 📌 Next Action Items

1. **Script Improvements**

   * Update `./start.sh` scripts to use **DNS names** instead of hardcoded server references.

2. **Jenkins Home Replication**

   * Ensure full `jenkins_home` directory synchronization between us-east-2 and us-west-2.
   * Since `jenkins_home` resides on **EFS**, evaluate and finalize replication strategy:

     * **AWS EFS Replication** (native, async) or
     * **AWS DataSync** (scheduled transfers).

3. **Automation**

   * Configure failover/failback scripts in **Harness**.
   * Work with **UC4 team** to create UC4 jobs that trigger Harness pipelines for DR automation.

4. **Further DR Testing**

   * Conduct another DR test, this time **via UC4 automation**, to validate end-to-end orchestration.
   * Include full validation of all 6 controllers.

---

## 🏆 Conclusion

The Jenkins DR test exposed critical gaps in automation, configuration, and replication, but also validated the **overall DR design and rollback capability**.
With identified improvements — script standardization, EFS replication, and automation via Harness/UC4 — future DR tests are expected to be **faster, smoother, and more reliable**.
